RESTSchemaRetry is a .NET library that implements a simple **Schema-Retry** pattern in REST API context to enhance application resilience.
A Schema-Retry handles transient failures when attempting to connect to a service or network resource by transparently retrying failed operations.

### How it works
RESTSchemaRetry implements a straightforward retry mechanism with a delay, managing communication timeouts or service errors transparently to the application.
The retry mechanism checks the HTTP response code to determine whether the error is transient or not.

### Transient error recovery
Below is the list of potentially transient errors handled by RESTSchemaRetry:
  * TooManyRequests
  * InternalServerError
  * BadGateway
  * ServiceUnavailable
  * GatewayTimeout
  * InsufficientStorage
  * RequestTimeout
  * HttpVersionNotSupported
  * NetworkAuthenticationRequired

### Supported Backoff Types

- **Constant Backoff**: The delay between retries is constant and does not change. This is a simple approach where each retry attempt waits for a fixed amount of time, defined by a `RetryDelay` parameter.
  
- **Linear Backoff**: The delay between retries increases linearly. Each retry attempt waits longer than the previous one by a fixed increment. The delay is calculated as `RetryDelay * (retry + 1)`.

- **Exponential Backoff**: The delay between retries grows exponentially. The delay is calculated using a power of 2, multiplied by the base RetryDelay. This approach is useful to quickly back off from a failing operation, reducing server load. Formula: `RetryDelay * (2 ^ retry)`.
  
- **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: Similar to exponential backoff, but with added randomness ("jitter") to the delay to avoid synchronized retries from multiple clients, which can cause spikes in traffic. The delay is calculated as `RetryDelay * (2 ^ retry) * random_factor`, where `random_factor` is a random value between 0 and 1.
  
- **Fibonacci Backoff**: The delay between retries follows the Fibonacci sequence. This provides a middle ground between linear and exponential backoff, growing less aggressively than exponential. The delay is calculated as `RetryDelay * Fibonacci(retry)`.
  
- **Randomized Backoff**: The delay is randomly chosen between a minimum and a maximum range, usually defined as a multiple of RetryDelay. This helps to distribute retries more evenly over time, avoiding bursts of traffic. The delay is calculated randomly within a range, e.g., `[RetryDelay, RetryDelay * 2]`.

- **Exponential Full Jitter Backoff**: This strategy provides exponential backoff with full jitter. Itâ€™s especially effective for reducing collision and spreading retries over `time.delay = random(0, RetryDelay * 2^retry)` (capped to a max delay).

### Backoff Strategies Comparison

| Backoff Type               | Description                                         | Pros                                            | Cons                                           | Recommended Use Case                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Constant**              | Fixed delay between retries                          | Simple, predictable                             | Can cause retry storms if many clients retry simultaneously | Simple scenarios with low contention               |
| **Linear**                | Delay increases linearly each retry                  | Gradual increase reduces load                    | May be too slow for high load                    | Moderate retry attempts where steady increase helps |
| **Exponential**           | Delay doubles every retry                             | Quickly reduces retries, eases server load       | Risk of synchronized retries                     | High contention, backend stress scenarios          |
| **Exponential with Jitter** | Exponential delay plus random jitter               | Avoids retry synchronization and traffic spikes | Less predictable delay                           | Distributed systems with many clients               |
| **Fibonacci**             | Delay follows Fibonacci sequence                      | Balanced growth, smoother than exponential      | Slightly more complex                            | When moderate backoff is preferred                   |
| **Randomized**            | Delay randomly chosen in a range                      | Spreads out retries, avoids bursts                | Delay is unpredictable                           | Systems sensitive to retry bursts                    |
| **Exponential Full Jitter**| Exponential delay with full jitter randomized        | Minimizes collision, best spread of retries      | More complex, highly variable delay              | Stateless retries, high concurrency environments     |

### How to use it

To use the RESTSchemaRetry library, just create a **RetryClient** specifying the base URL and the resource.
There are multiple constructor to specify the REST API parameters.

```csharp
var retryClient = new RetryClient("https://example.com/","your-rest-resourse");
```
at this point the REST API requests can be performed.
For example, below how to execute a POST request:

```csharp
var response = retryClient.Post<TRequest, TResponse>(objectToPost);
```
Alternatively, you can register the library via dependency injection as follows:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRetryClient("https://your-base-url.com", "your-rest-resourse");
```

RESTSchemaRetry uses the **RestSharp** library to execute the web requests.
